# Algorithm development

This repository collects all the scripts and tests used for the thesis [https://odr.chalmers.se/items/c3292fd0-4ed0-428b-b886-d5ae82b3247e](Mechatronics Optimization and Development for Wind Tunnel Tests)

Advanced and cool plots have been designed. Feel free to take inspiration!

The Surrogate Model was developed by [https://github.com/MrUrq](MrUrq) and here forked. It is quite heavy to run, so its output was collected in the data folder.
